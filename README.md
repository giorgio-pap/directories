# Directories
**An uncreative poetry project**

## Introduction
**Directories** is a project of uncreative writing. This project involves the realization of five volumes of poems, created following the same procedure. The five volumes together consist of a list of directories and files that can be found on my laptop (last check on August 13, 2021). Names of directories and files have been extracted automatically. No edit has been made. Nothing has been hidden, nothing has been added. Names of directories are used as poem titles. Names of files are used as poem lines. The script used for these volumes can be found using the QR code here below. It can be used freely to create everyone’s personal digital epic poem.
