# Directories
**An uncreative poetry project**

## Introduction
**Directories** is a project of uncreative writing. This project involves the realization of five volumes of poems, created following the same procedure. 

The five volumes together consist of a list of directories and files that can be found on my laptop (last check on August 13, 2021). Names of directories and files have been extracted automatically. 

No edit has been made. Nothing has been hidden, nothing has been added. 

Names of directories are used as poem titles. Names of files are used as poem lines. 

## Books
The various volumes of **Directories** can be found [here](https://www.giorgiopapitto-poesia.it/directories). It is possible to freely read all of them. You can request me free .pdf files or paperback copies (limited to 20 copies for each volume in total).

## Code
The script has been written using **Python**. It requires the following packages to run:
- [python-docx](https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/)
- [natsort](https://pypi.org/project/natsort/)

If you want to replicate this project, feel free to do it. It would be great if you could mention the Directories project when using it.

If you want to collaborate on some more uncreative writing projects, feel free to contact me.
